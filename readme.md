### 6. Answer the following questions clearly:

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?
   Ans: getElementById is used for selecting a single element by its unique id attribute.  
   getElementsByClassName is used for selecting elements by their class name.  
   querySelector is used for selecting the first element (ID, class or tag name) that matches a specified CSS selector.
   querySelectorAll is used for selecting all elements (class, tag name) that match a specified CSS selector.

2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?
   Creating and inserting a new element into the DOM involves several steps. At first, creating a new HTML tag name/element in JS using document. createElement() and inserting the element into the DOM. Then append or insert the element into an existing parent element within the DOM by using appendChild(); it appends the new element as the last child of a specified parent element.
